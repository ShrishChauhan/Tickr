## Session 0 — 2026-06-22 — Phase 0: scaffold and setup

### Done
- Created `E:\Projects\equity-research-app\`, git init, and made `.gitignore` the literal first commit so no secrets could ever sneak into history.
- Scaffolded the full folder tree: `engine/app/{schema,adapters,cache,analysis,db,api}`, `web/`, `docs/`, plus all `__init__.py` stubs and stub files with `TODO(Phase N)` markers.
- Defined the **internal normalized schema** in `engine/app/schema/` — this is the one real design decision of Phase 0, since all other layers depend on it:
  - `company.py`: `CompanyIdentity` with `Market`, `Exchange`, `Currency` enums — market-aware from day one; India enum values present but unused until Phase 4.
  - `fundamentals.py`: `NormalizedFundamentals` wrapping `IncomeStatement`, `BalanceSheet`, `CashFlowStatement`, `Ratios`, plus `Period` enum (annual/quarterly/TTM). All financial fields `Optional[float]` — None means not reported, not zero.
  - `filings.py`: `FilingReference` + `FilingType` enum covering US (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A) and India placeholders (Phase 4).
- Defined the **adapter interface** in `engine/app/adapters/base.py` — abstract async `DataAdapter` with `get_company`, `get_fundamentals`, `get_filings`. Created `edgar.py` and `yfinance.py` stubs that raise `NotImplementedError("TODO(Phase 1)")`.
- Stubbed the **cache layer** (`cache/base.py`, `cache/ttl_config.py` with TTL constants), **analysis interface** (`analysis/interface.py`), and **DB layer** (`db/models.py` with a `CacheEntry` table, `db/session.py`).
- Wrote `engine/app/config.py` using pydantic-settings; `engine/app/main.py` with FastAPI + `/health` and `/api/v1` prefix; `engine/app/api/health.py` as a dedicated router.
- Set up Python 3.11 venv at `engine/.venv` and installed all deps from `pyproject.toml` (editable install): fastapi, uvicorn, edgartools 5.39.0, yfinance 1.4.1, sqlalchemy 2.0.51, alembic 1.18.4, httpx, python-dotenv, pydantic 2.13.4, pydantic-settings, psycopg2-binary — all installed cleanly.
- Initialized Alembic in `engine/alembic/`; edited `env.py` to load `DATABASE_URL` from settings and wire `Base.metadata` for autogenerate.
- Installed Node.js 24.17.0 via winget. Scaffolded Next.js 14 (TypeScript, App Router, ESLint, no Tailwind) in `web/`.
- Verified `/health` endpoint live: `GET http://localhost:8001/health` → `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","environment":"development"}`.
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (lean index), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (full design diagram + rules), `.env.example`.
- 4 commits total: `.gitignore` → engine scaffold → Next.js → docs.

### Next
- Phase 1: implement `EdgarAdapter` using edgartools — `get_company` (CIK lookup), `get_filings` (10-K/10-Q search), `get_fundamentals` (XBRL financial data).
- Phase 1: implement `YFinanceAdapter` for prices and basic fundamentals as a complement to EDGAR.
- Phase 1: wire up `GET /api/v1/companies/{ticker}` and `GET /api/v1/companies/{ticker}/fundamentals` routes in `engine/app/api/routes.py`.
- Set up PostgreSQL (local or hosted) and set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, then run `alembic upgrade head`.

### Open decisions
- None blocking Phase 1. PostgreSQL can wait until Phase 2 (cache layer); Phase 1 routes can return live-fetched data without caching.
- `LLM_API_KEY` left empty in `.env` — stub only, not needed until Phase 2 analysis layer.

### Roadblocks & Resolutions
- **Wrong build backend in `pyproject.toml`:** First pip install attempt failed with `BackendUnavailable: Cannot import 'setuptools.backends.legacy'`. I had used `setuptools.backends.legacy:build` (wrong) instead of `setuptools.build_meta` (correct). Fixed the `[build-system]` section and reinstalled — resolved.
- **winget Node.js search hung:** `winget search "NodeJS"` hung indefinitely (exit 255). Skipped the search, went straight to `winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e` — installed cleanly in ~2 minutes.
- **uvicorn background job:** Running uvicorn via PowerShell background job (`Start-Job`) failed to connect because the job environment didn't inherit the working directory. Switched to `System.Diagnostics.Process` with explicit `WorkingDirectory` — health check passed.
- **PostgreSQL not installed:** No local Postgres. Alembic is scaffolded and configured but migrations cannot run until `DATABASE_URL` is set in `.env`. Noted in CLAUDE.md. Not a blocker for Phase 1 (adapters + routes don't need the DB yet).
